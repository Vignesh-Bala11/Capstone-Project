Need Input on a Catchy Title, not Capstone Project

Sports present a vast amount of data which have been used to create a whole new paradigm of preformance, team management and strategies. In basketball data has revolutionzed the game by almost eliminating the need of a mid-range jumpshot, in baseball the Oakland Atheltics general Manager Billy Beane recronstuced a championship level team by soley relying on data and a minimal budget and there are many more examples across sports. Among with the benefits of high level data analysis there unfortunately is drawback which is has the sports industry over-compensated in their use of data rather than the skill of the athelte. One sport in particular that has raised this question and has torn a fanbase is Formula 1. Many of the atheletes such as (Insert article) have claimed that the sport is to predictable. The team has decided to see if the atheletes statements is true decided to build a race predictor to either support or deny the atheletes claim.

In the world of sports, the impact of data has changed how we view sports from team managment, athelte performance and many other facetes. Examples that emphasize these changes include the 
revolutionization of the way basketball is played as the mid-range jumper has essentially been eliminated, in baseball the former general manager of the Oakland Atheltics formed a championship team based on pure data analysis and a minimal budget. With all the advancements through "sports analytics" there unforntunately are drawbacks, with the biggest one being are analytics disregarding pure skill of the athlete and trying to fit them in the mold of what the data says. One sport that emphasizes this split between skill and data is Formula 1 (F1) as standout athletes such as (insert article athelete here) stated that the sport has become to predictable. The team decided to test this theory through the development of a race predictor. One other facet of F1 the team decided to face is (question insert here).

## Initial Project...
1) Are formula 1 races predicatable and to what degree of accuracy?
2) Can we create segmented race strategies for Formula1 constructors depending of circuit level historical performance?
