# Race Predictibility of Formula 1
Sports present a vast amount of data that have been used to create a whole new paradigm of preformance, team management and strategies. In basketball data has revolutionzed the game by almost eliminating the need of a mid-range jumpshot, in baseball the Oakland Atheltics general Manager Billy Beane recronstuced a championship level team by soley relying on data and a minimal budget and there are many more examples across sports. Amongst the benefits of high level data analysis there unfortunately are drawbacks with the biggest one being, is the sports industry over-compensated in their use of data rather than the skill of the athelte. One sport in particular that has raised this question and has torn a fanbase is Formula 1 (F1). Formula 1 represents the pinnacle of automotive technology with hundreds of cars being fitted with state of the art sensors generating significant amount of data which teams monitor to determine tire preformance, driver preformance, track condirions etc. Few sports rely on the use of data analytics as extensively as F1 and as such major Technology companies such as Amazon Web Services, Qualcom Technologies, Splunk all have major strategic relations with the competing teams. Given the large amount of resources being diverted to the data-side of F1, the team is attempting to answer the following questions:


    1) Are Races to Predictable?
    2) Can we create segmented race strategies for Formula1 constructors depending of circuit level historical performance?
