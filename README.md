Need Input on a Catchy Title, not Capstone Project

Sports present a vast amount of data which have been used to create a whole new paradigm of preformance, team management and strategies. In basketball data has revolutionzed the game by almost eliminating the need of a mid-range jumpshot, in baseball the Oakland Atheltics general Manager Billy Beane recronstuced a championship level team by soley relying on data and a minimal budget and there are many more examples across sports. Among with the benefits of high level data analysis there unfortunately is drawback which is has the sports industry over-compensated in their use of data rather than the skill of the athelte. One sport in particular that has raised this question and has torn a fanbase is Formula 1. Many of the atheletes such as (Insert article) have claimed that the sport is to predictable. The team has decided to see if the atheletes statements is true decided to build a race predictor to either support or deny the atheletes claim.

The purpose of this project is to determine the predicitibility of Formula 1 (F1) races regardless of event size. 

1) Are formula 1 races predicatable and to what degree of accuracy?
2) Can we create segmented race strategies for Formula1 constructors depending of circuit level historical performance?
